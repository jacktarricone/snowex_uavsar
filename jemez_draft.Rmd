abstract: |
  Snow is a critical water resource for the western US and many regions across the globe. However, our ability to accurately measure and monitor changes in snowpack from satellite remote sensing, specifically its water equivalent, is challenged in mountain regions. To confront these challenges, NASA initiated the SnowEx program, a multi-year effort to address knowledge gaps in snow remote sensing. In the winter of 2020, SnowEx acquired UAVSAR L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series to evaluate its capabilities and limitations for tracking changes in snow water equivalent (SWE). It was tested in a range of snow cover, land cover, and climatic conditions across the western US. A more comprehensive understanding of these limitations will allow the snow community to leverage the upcoming NASA-ISRO (NISAR) mission with its L-band radar. This study analyzed two InSAR pairs from the Jemez River Basin (JRB), NM, between February 12-26, 2020. We developed an end-to-end UAVSAR InSAR processing workflow for snow applications. This open-source approach employs a novel data fusion method that merges optical snow-covered area (SCA) with InSAR data. Combining these two remote sensing data sets allows for robust atmospheric correction and proper delineation of snow-covered pixels. For both pairs, we converted phase change values to SWE change estimations between the two data acquisition dates. We then evaluated radar-derived retrievals using a combination of snow pits, meteorological station data, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. The results of this study show that this InSAR approach is effective for measuring changes in SWE, even in relatively warm snow conditions. Future work will refine the InSAR optical fusion technique and investigate the performance impacts of landscape and snowpack characteristics such as liquid water content, forest cover, elevation, slope, and aspect.

# Introduction
    In the western US, seasonal mountain snowpack is the primary water source, providing water for about 60 million people (Stewart et al., 2004). The snowmelt flows directly to users downstream, stored in reservoirs to generate hydropower, or is diverted far beyond the catchment boundaries. This makes snowmelt a highly variable but essential resource for the entire western US population, not just the locations near mountains. The snowpack acts as a reservoir in the winter as it accumulates and stores the frozen snowfall (Bales et al., 2006). Every spring, it releases the water as snowmelt, which flows down the catchment to recharge groundwater and fill up man-made reservoirs. Humans use this water for agriculture, industry, ecosystem services, and almost every other facet of modern life. To correctly manage these resources, society needs accurate knowledge of how much water is held in the seasonal snowpack and when that water will be released as snowmelt. \par
  Currently, our estimation of the spatial and temporal variations in mountain SWE remains imprecise (Dozier, 2011). The Natural Resource Conservation Services (NRCS) Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network uses snow pillows and courses to monitor snow at point-based locations. This information is then used by National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers to inform statistically-based streamflow forecasting models, without assimilating any of the remote sensing data products (Pagano et al., 2004). \par
Climate warming is affecting the stationarity of various components of the hydrologic cycle across the globe (Milly et al., 2008). In the dry mountain western US, changes from snowfall to rainfall and less precipitation could significantly impact society by changing the magnitude and timing of the spring streamflow (Harpold et al., 2017a). This, in turn, decreases our ability to predict and forecast streamflow because it violates the statistical assumption of stationarity in the regression-based models (A. A. Harpold et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2011). Therefore, we need to look to remote sensing tools for a more accurate understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of our mountain snowpack. \par
  There is a rich history of remote sensing of various snowpack properties, dating back to the first Earth observing satellites (Barnes & Bowley, 1968). These properties include snow-covered area (SCA), snow albedo, snow grain size, snowpack wetness, snow depth, and SWE. While the ability to measure these properties provides useful information in the different SWE estimation techniques, there is still no single remote sensing technique that can continually measure SWE from space for mountain snowpack applications (Lettenmaier et al., 2015). \par
Optical remote sensing satellites such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Landsat can produce both SCA and fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) maps through a spectral unmixing analysis (Bair et al., 2019; Dozier, 1989; Painter et al., 2009; Rittger et al., 2013). Suborbital lidar (Painter et al., 2016) combined with hyperspectral imaging (A. Nolin et al., 1993; A. W. Nolin & Dozier, 1993) are mature techniques for sensing both depth and fSCA at the watershed scale. To convert these optical measurements into SWE, both require spatially distributed snowpack energy balance models. Like all optical techniques, they are limited by cloud cover, which is frequent in mountain environments. \par
  Passive microwave emissions have been used to estimate SWE (Dong et al., 2005; Foster et al., 2005; Vuyovich et al., 2014). These measurements have a large spatial resolution (25x25 km), and cannot capture the topographic heterogeneity of mountain environments. This technique is also limited by deep snowpack (>1m), and the presence of liquid water within the snowpack, which are common in mountain environments. While passive microwave isn’t suited for mountain environments, other radar techniques should be considered. \par
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing technique that shows promise for snowpack monitoring. It addresses the two main deficiencies in both optical and passive microwave; it can penetrate through clouds and has a spatial resolution on the scale of tens of meters instead of kilometers. Recently, there has been substantial growth in the use of SAR data for many Earth science disciplines due to the increase in available sensors, ease of data processing and image focusing, and access to cloud-based data products. The data volume will only increase with the planned launch of NISAR, Surface Water Ocean Topography Mission (SWOT), Radar Observing System for Europe L-Band  (ROSE-L), and the continuation of Sentinel-1 mission. \par
  SAR backscatter has been used to estimate SWE at shorter wavelengths (Ku, Ka, X) (Rott et al., 2011; J. Shi & Dozier, 2000; Jiancheng Shi et al., 1994; Tsang et al., in review). This method requires a complex radiative transfer model with input parameters that include snow density, snow temperature, and grain size, which are challenging to estimate over large spatial scales precisely. SAR is robust for measuring snow wetness (Nagler, 1996; Nagler et al., 2016), and new backscatter methods are being developed to measure snow depth at C-band (Lievens et al., 2019, 2021) \par
  Recently, the use of InSAR to estimate SWE has become an area of interest because of the higher temporal (12 days) frequency and L-band wavelength of NISAR. InSAR uses the differences in radar phase between subsequent overpasses to estimate surface displacement. The SWE InSAR theory, initially proposed by Guneriussen et al. (2000), relates changes in the interferometric phase of a radar signal to changes in dry snow on the ground between acquisitions. This technique is limited to dry snow because the presence of liquid water vastly increases the dielectric permittivity value of snow and thus reduces the backscattering coefficient. These dielectric losses cause the signal to attenuate in the snowpack and not scatter off the snow-ground interface, therefore breaking down the physical basis of the technique (Nagler, 1996). \par
  After publication of the initial theory, follow-up studies were performed by Rott et al. (2003) in Austria and Deeb et al. (2011) on Alaska’s north slope, both using ERS-1 C-band radar. Leinss et al. (2015) conducted an intensive season-long ground-based dual-frequency (X and Ku)   interferometric experiment in Finland. They found the method was successful for continually measuring SWE in dry taiga snow, but that liquid water and vegetation would quickly cause loss of coherence. The Sentinel-1 C-band radar was used more recently, leveraging the more consistent overpass repeat cycle (Conde et al., 2019). These orbital InSAR studies showed promise for estimating SWE but lacked sufficient temporal length and variety of vegetation, topography, and snowpack characteristics to thoroughly understand the technique’s limitations and synergies with other types of snow measurements. \par

# Methods
## Study Area Description

Located in northern New Mexico, the Jemez Mountains, and Jemez River are on the southern extent of the Rocky Mountains. The Jemez River research site is the furthest south of the 13 SnowEx 2020 campaign sites (Figure 2) and has a varied and unique hydroclimatic, topographic, and vegetated environment. Within the Jemez River Basin lies Valles Caldera, a 25-km wide volcanic structure dating back about 1.2 million years. Within Valles Caldera, the Valle Grande is an extensive open grassland where field measurements took place for this study. Many resurgent lava domes form peaks over the grassy valleys, the highest of Redondo Peak (11,253 ft).

## Data Description

For this study, we are analyzing two UAVSAR L-band InSAR image pairs in the Jemez River Basin, NM from 2/12 - 2/19 and 2/19 - 2/26. UAVSAR is full polarimetric L-band radar deployed on a NASA Gulf Stream III aircraft, traditionally flown at 45,000 ft with a 16 km nominal range swath width (Rosen et al., 2006). The flight management system and  GPS are precise enough for conducting InSAR measurements. On these dates, field teams measured snowpack density, depth, wetness, temperature, stratigraphy, and grain size. Researchers also collected data using a ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which will be used to validate the InSAR-derived changes in SWE at scales from meters to a kilometer. Landsat fSCA data from 2/18/2020 will be used to identify snow-covered pixels. Within the radar swath, there are two SNOTEL sites (Garita Peak & Quemazon), and three meteorologic stations, which will be used to help validate the radar SWE retrievals.
